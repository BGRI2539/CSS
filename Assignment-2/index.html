        <p>I once met a man in a dream one night</p>
        <p>Who seemed to have nothing to lose </p>
        <p>Oh, his eyes were like two red, fiery pits </p>
        <p>He stumbled up to me like he'd, had a few </p>
        <br />
        <p>He looked me in the eyes, and without a word </p>
        <p>He saw right through my soul </p>
        <p>And with an evil little grin, and a stench of sin </p>
        <p>He delivered me a message that I'll never forget </p>
        <br />
        <p>Put your hands up, this is your last chance </p>
        <p>So boy, prepare to die</p>
        <p>Get ready to meet your maker </p>
        <p>Before I put one right between your eyes </p>
        <p>Get ready (get ready) </p>
        <p>For your resignation</p>
        <br />
        <p>Get ready (get ready) </p>
        <p>For your salvation </p>
        <p>'Cause when you wake up, you'll realize </p>
        <p>Who even cares if you're dead </p>
        <p>If youwere never alive </p>
        <br />
        <p>I won't pretend that I'm a tough guy </p>
        <p>I'd like to think I value my life </p>
        <p>I remember father told me never turn down a fight</p>
        <p>You see, I've got a few tricks up my own sleeve </p>
        <p>And none of them involve giving in to nothing </p>
        <br />
        <p>So I charged at the man and I threw up my hands </p>
        <p>Balled up my fists, swing as hard as I can </p>
        <p>But to my surprise, he was faster than I </p>
        <p>And the next thing I know, I feel colder than ice</p>
        <br />
        <p>Put your hands up, this is your last chance </p>
        <p>So boy, prepare to die</p>
        <p>Get ready to meet your maker</p>
        <p>Before I put one right between your eyes </p>
        <p>Get ready (get ready) </p>
        <p>For your resignation</p>
        <p>Get ready (get ready)</p>
        <p>For your salvation </p>
        <p>'Cause when I woke up, and I opened my eyes </p>
        <p>I'll remember what he said with every ounce of my life </p>
        <br />
        <p>Put your hands up, this is your last chance</p>
        <p>So boy, prepare to die</p>
        <p>Get ready to meet your maker</p>
        <p>Before I put one right between your eyes</p>
        <p>Get ready (get ready)</p>
        <p>For your resignation</p>
        <br />
        <p>Get ready (get ready)</p>
        <p>For your salvation</p>
        <p>'Cause when I woke up, I realized</p>
        <p>That no one cares if I'm dead </p>
        <p>If I was never alive </p>
        <br />
        <p>Put your hands up, this is your last chance</p>
        <p>So boy, prepare to die</p>
        <p>Get ready to meet your maker</p>
        <p>Before I put one right between your eyes</p> 
        <p>Get ready </p>
        <p>For your resignation </p>
        <p>Get ready</p>
        <p>For your salvation</p>
