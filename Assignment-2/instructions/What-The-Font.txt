=== What The Font Instructions ===

1. Pick a song that you love and get the lyrics from an online source. The
lyrics must be in English, if your song is in another language please
translate the lyrics.

2. Using valid HTML, create the structure of the web page. The HTML
should:
    a. Use the required metadata.
    b. Use the appropriate semantic elements.
    c. Use the correct content elements.

3. Style the page using CSS that is contained in a separate CSS file. When
styling the page consider the following:
    a. Does this follow a colour scheme.
    b. Does the color scheme reflect the band logo or album work.

4. Add some images ... maybe even the music video!

5. Use at least two different fonts (you will likely need more than two).

6. Style the text using various font properties; remember, you are trying to
relay the emotion behind the lyrics!

7. Add comments to your HTML & CSS files.

8. Validate the HTML using the W3C HTML validation tool.

9. And have fun with this ... BE CREATIVE!!!
